**Wargame AI project for COMP 472**

**AI Wargame** is a two-player strategic board game where players take on the roles of an attacker (a) and a defender (d) on a 5 Ã— 5 game board. The objective of the game is for the attacker to destroy the defender's AI unit while the defender aims to protect their AI. This readme provides an overview of the game rules and how to play.

**Game Overview**
In **AI Wargame**, each player controls a set of 6 units, with each unit belonging to one of five types:

1.**AI (A)**: Each player has only 1 AI unit, and the primary goal is to destroy the opponent's AI to win the game.

2.**Viruses (V)**: Viruses are highly offensive units capable of destroying the opponent's AI in a single attack.

3.**Techs (T)**: Techs are defensive units. Techs and Viruses are equally matched in combat when facing each other.

4.**Programs (P)**: Programs are generic soldiers with balanced abilities.

5.**Firewalls (F)**: Firewalls are strong at absorbing attacks but weak at dealing damage to other units.

Each unit has an associated health level, represented by an integer between 0 and 9, with full health being 9. When a unit's health level reaches 0 or goes below 0, the unit is destroyed and removed from the board. If a player's AI unit is destroyed, that player loses the game.

**How to Play**
1.**Objective**: The attacker's objective is to destroy the defender's AI unit, while the defender's goal is to protect their AI.

2.**Turn-based Gameplay**: Players take turns to perform actions with their units. On a player's turn, they can choose one unit to perform an action, which can include moving, attacking, or defending.

3.**Unit Actions**:

* Viruses are highly offensive and can destroy an opponent's AI in one attack.
* Techs are defensive units and have an advantage when facing Viruses.
* Programs are versatile and can engage in standard combat.
* Firewalls are sturdy but not very effective in combat.
* AI units must be protected at all costs, as losing an AI unit results in losing the game.

4.**Unit Health**: Keep track of the health levels of your units. Units with 0 or negative health are removed from the board.

5.**Game Progression**: The game continues until one player's AI unit is destroyed, leading to a victory for the opposing player.
